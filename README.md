# HelpfulPrintableCalendar

Tiny little single-file HTML/CSS/JavaScript program to make a "working on interests" calendar.


## Publishing

Publishing is actually trivial: simply update the underlying Github page **on the main branch**. 

The single index.html file is published to the [Azure Link](https://victorious-sand-02c52ff1e.azurestaticapps.net/index.html) at https://victorious-sand-02c52ff1e.azurestaticapps.net/index.html

I'm the owner of the Azure static web site. 

* Sign in to [azure.com](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) with the shipwrecksoftwave@live.com credentials.
* Go to the Azure portal and find, under resources, the [HelpfulPrintableCalendar](https://portal.azure.com/#@shipwrecksoftwarelive.onmicrosoft.com/resource/subscriptions/91815abe-f7cb-452f-8cec-8ea7fca14cd7/resourcegroups/Default-Web-WestUS/providers/Microsoft.Web/staticSites/HelpfulPrintableCalendar/staticsite) static site.
* Note that the source is the main branch on github! Look at the "source" item and notice that it says "main (Github)".
